                  I am a citizen of planet earth, with {calculateAge(new Date(1987, 0, 19))} old I have had the pleassure to live in{' '}

                <p>
                  I really like stay at home and watch some random TV Shows, play my video games or just read a book. It so relaxing having
                  time with myself (I am getting old I know üòî). When I am not too lazy, I like to go outside and do some excercise or
                  sport.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I use to play a lot of Volleyball back in the University and I really liked it. However, I am not what I used to be. I
                  dont play as much as I liked, but I am always looking for ways to hit some ball.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition to sports, I aim to exercise at least 4 times a week, I have tried everything where Crossfit has been the most
                  successful. This change since I move to Australia, here the Crossfit is too expensive and I am not in the best shape, so I
                  choose to do normal gym. When this doesn`t work, I bought a Tacx indoor trainer and has been my best partner since then.
                  Dont take me wrong I am keen to start Crossfit again.

                  Finally, I got into the business of boardgames {calculateAge(new Date(2016, 8, 8))} ago, I totally blame Pandemic and
                  Catan. I left my small collection in Spain, but I have started another collection in Australia, where Arkham Horror LCG is
                  the main game.
